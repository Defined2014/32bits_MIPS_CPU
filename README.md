# 32bits_MIPS_CPU
Using Verilog to achieve a 32 bits pipeline CPU
There are three floders. 

1.The ISE floder includes Xilink ISE files. 

2.The SIM floder includes simulation results and test bench files.

3.The SRC floder includes source files.

The project is based on the Xilink 10.1. 

I use Modelsim 6.5 to simulate the project.
